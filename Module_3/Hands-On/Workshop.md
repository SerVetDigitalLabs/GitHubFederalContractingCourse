# Module 3 Hands-On Workshop Guide

## Federal Contract Amendment Project

### Objective
You will use GitHub to manage and streamline the amendment process for a federal contract. By completing this workshop, you will demonstrate your ability to effectively use issues, labels, project boards, and pull requests within GitHub.

### Requirements
- A GitHub account
- Internet access
- Access to the course's main repository in GitHub

### Workshop Tasks

#### Task 1: Create and Organize Issues

1. **Navigate to the Repository**:
   - Log in to your GitHub account.
   - Go to the `Module_3/Hands-On` directory in the course repository.

2. **Create Issues for Contract Amendments**:
   - Click on the 'Issues' tab at the top of the repository page.
   - Click 'New issue' for each part of the contract that needs amending. For example:
     - Title: Update Contract Scope
     - Title: Revise Budget Allocation
     - Title: Modify Timeline
   - Provide a description of what needs to be done in the comment box.

3. **Categorize with Labels**:
   - While creating each issue, click on the 'Labels' on the right side and choose or create labels such as `revision-needed` or `urgent`.

#### Task 2: Use Project Boards for Tracking

1. **Create a Project Board**:
   - Go to the 'Projects' tab at the top of the repository page.
   - Click 'New project', name it "Contract Amendment Process", and create a basic kanban template.

2. **Add Issues to the Project Board**:
   - On your project board, click 'Add cards' and drag your created issues into the 'To Do' column.

3. **Manage Workflow**:
   - Move issues across columns as you work on them, such as to 'In Progress' and then to 'Review' or 'Done'.

#### Task 3: Collaborate with Pull Requests

1. **Edit Contract Document**:
   - Navigate to the 'Code' section of the repository.
   - Find the contract document, likely named something like `Contract.md` in the 'Module_3/Hands-On' directory.
   - Click the pencil icon (Edit this file) to make amendments directly in the web interface.

2. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - After making changes, scroll down to "Propose file change" and then click on "Create pull request".
   - Link the pull request to the related issues by mentioning them (#IssueNumber) in the pull request description.

3. **Merge Changes**:
   - Once reviewed (you can review it yourself for this exercise), click 'Merge pull request' to apply the changes to the main branch.

#### Task 4: Reflect on the Process

1. **Review Your Project Board**:
   - Return to your project board and ensure all tasks reflect their current status.
   - Think about how this visual tool has helped manage and track the amendment process.

2. **Consider the Outcomes**:
   - Reflect on how using issues, labels, and project boards contributed to organizing and streamlining the amendment process.
   - Consider the ease of collaboration and review when using pull requests.

### Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the Module 3 hands-on workshop! You've now practiced using GitHub's collaborative tools in the context of federal contracting. Consider how these skills can be applied to your current or future projects to enhance efficiency, transparency, and collaboration.

Remember, this is just a starting pointâ€”the more you use these tools, the more proficient you'll become. Good luck!
